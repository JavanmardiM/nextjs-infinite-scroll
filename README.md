# Infinite Scroll in Next.js

This is a Next.js project demonstrating **Infinite Scroll** functionality. It loads more content as you scroll down the page. The content is fetched using **TanStack Query**, and the page URL updates dynamically to reflect the current page (e.g., `/news/page/2`).

## Features

- Infinite Scroll that fetches more data as the user scrolls.
- URL updates with each page load (e.g., `/news/page/2`).
- If JavaScript is disabled, a "Next Page" button will appear for navigation.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** - React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **TypeScript** - Superset of JavaScript that adds type safety.
- **TanStack Query** - Data fetching and state management for React.
- **CSS** - For styling the components.
